# Beginning with the Mobile Automation Journey

So, I've been working as a software tester for 2 years now. But to be honest, hardly I had the chance on doing projects that are solely based on mobile related testing. And this often comes to haunt me because of the fact, whenever I face a job interview, this question comes up often - "Have you done any mobile testing?" And I have no solid proof of work to show or discuss with the interviewers. 

To be honest, today, many companies solely work on web. No real need for them to have native apps.

But as a Tester, I need to know my way around testing a mobile application. And doing that manually won't be that hard, but knowing how to automate things can be a little tricky to learn.

So, why not begin our journey there.

This is why, I thought about learning the Appium tool. This is an open source mobile automation tool that supports a wide variety of langugages like java, javascript, python, php and so on. 

But before embarking this journey, first I need to go through the tedious process of installing the tool in my device. As I'm using Ubuntu operating system, I will share how I've completed the installation in my next blog.

For other OS users like windows or mac, you will find plenty of tutorials or articles that you can follow. Or you can even follow me too as most of the steps will be similar. 

Sorry, if I've wasted your time. But today, I just wanted to talk about why this is the first thing on my agenda. Nothing insightful, I know. But stay with me, as this Noob Tester would go through a rollercoaster of a ride in learning this awesome tool called "Appium" in the upcoming days.
